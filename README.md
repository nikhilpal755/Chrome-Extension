# Chrome-Extension 


I've built a chrome extension using HTML , CSS and Javascript
Features : 
   -> Fetch the current URL and add as a bookmark  (Save tab button) 
   -> Bookmark can be added using user input (Save input button )
   -> Bookmark is available even after closing the current window or switching off computer
   -> Delete all the tabs by double clicking delete button
