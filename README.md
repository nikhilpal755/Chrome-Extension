# Chrome-Extension 


I've built a chrome extension using HTML , CSS and Javascript </br>
Features : </br>
   -> Fetch the current URL and add as a bookmark  (Save tab button) </br>
   -> Bookmark can be added using user input (Save input button ) </br>
   -> Bookmark is available even after closing the current window or switching off computer </br>
   -> Delete all the tabs by double clicking delete button </br>
